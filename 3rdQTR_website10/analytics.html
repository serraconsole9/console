        <h1>Comprehensive Paper</h1>
        <h2 id="one">I. Stream Overview</h2>
        <p>The members of Group 9 Serra Console launched their very first gaming livestream on Facebook last February 3, 2023, at 2:00 PM.
             The streamers of the group, Sean and Ellis, played Doors on Roblox, which is a first-person horror game with the goal of reaching 
             the last door at Level 100, while avoiding entities that will attempt to kill the players within the lobby. The members aside the 
             streamers on the other hand, naming Rhian, Raven and Aleah took part in technical and moderator duties.
            </p>

        <p>
            The streamers took responsibility in following the stream outline, following every activity listed successfully. After engaging 
            with the viewers and playing a round by themselves, Sean and Ellis invited the viewers to play the game with them. On the other hand,
            the moderators actively shared the stream on their personal accounts, and also interacted with the commenters in the stream’s chat box.
            Correspondingly, these actions helped in achieving the main goal of the stream: to have a relaxing and an out-going space for the stream’s
            viewers. However, during the stream, the streamers faced a few casualties in the technical side, mainly revolving around their audio and 
            camera. Fortunately, the streamers addressed the issue at hand with ease and swiftly continued.
        </p>

        <p>
            When the stream was about to end, the streamers asked their viewers to answer a form for their evaluation on Serra Console’s first 
            livestream. Through this, the members gained knowledge in the things they did well, along with the areas they need to improve on.
        </p>

        <h2 id="two">II. Things Well Done</h2>

        <p>It is mentioned in Section 1: Stream Overview that Serra Console encountered a few technical problems during
             their first live stream, but the group was able to address the problem swiftly and was able to continue

            Satisfaction as Fair. proving that Serra Console’s first live streaming was successful in providing an enjoyable 
            experience to the viewers.
        </p>

        <h2 id="three">III. Areas of Opportunity</h2>
        <h4>1. Improve Streaming Layout</h4>
        <p>Serra Console received suggestions from the audience to “adjust the gameplay screen” and make it bigger as they found
             it hard to watch the streaming session because of its current size. The team also received suggestions to “improve
              their streaming chat box layering” because it was seen overlapping during the streaming session. After both of these 
              feedbacks are taken into consideration, Serra Console members are now planning to improve their official streaming 
              layout to fix and improve their gameplay screen and chat box layering to make it more pleasing to the audience’s eyes. 
            </p> 

        <h4>2. Better Audio Quality </h4>
        <p>
            A number of viewers also brought up the group’s poor audio quality during their first live stream, the viewers demanded 
            louder and clearer audio from the streamers of Serra Console for there were times when they were hard to understand 
            because of poor audio quality. The streamers of Serra Console assure their audience that in their next live stream,
             their audio quality will be better.
        </p> 

        <h4>3. Wider Game Variety</h4>
        <p>
            Before the actual live stream starts, the streamers prepare a list of games in Roblox that they will be playing during 
            the streaming session to avoid any time conflicts meaning that the games played during the streaming session are only limited 
            to the list prepared beforehand. As a result, the audience suggested that Serra Console should have more variety of games to
             offer to make the streaming experience more enjoyable. Because of this, Serra Console members are now considering using a poll
              before every stream to let the viewers choose the live stream’s games in order to make fun and quality streaming contents that 
              the audience will surely enjoy.
        </p>

        <h4>4. Introduction Incident</h4>
        <p>
            Before the introduction of the live stream, the group encountered an incident wherein the streamers of Serra Console forgot
             to mute their audios in the broadcasting application because of this the early viewers of the live stream heard the streamers 
             having a conversation during the starting screen was shown. This incident somehow made the group seem unprofessional, which is 
             why the group and the viewers see this as an area in need of improvement. 
        </p>

        <h4>5. More Talks </h4>
        <p>In the Appendix A: figure 15 it is shown that 5.0% of Serra Console’s viewers suggested the group to have more talking sessions 
            during their live streaming sessions. This is seen as an area of opportunity by the group because it is also shown at figures 5 
            and 13 that the viewers think the stream lacked in sharing relevant and new information. Which is why as resolution to these three 
            feedbacks, the Serra Console streamers are thinking of preparing new segments wherein they share/talk about information that is 
            both relevant and new to their viewers. 
        </p>

    <h2 id="four">IV. Level of Engagement</h2>
    <p>
        The streamers promoted Serra Console and aired their very first livestream on their chosen platform Facebook. Before the actual livestream,
         the streamers posted promotional materials to encourage their target audience to like and follow their page, as well as to invite them
          to catch their first live scheduled on February 3, 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to the generated data and graphs from Facebook MetaBusiness Suite (See Appendix B, Figure 16 to 18) after an initial poster 
        was posted and shared by the members in their personal accounts on January 28, the page reached 124 users, had 185 visits, and garnered
         7 likes. Similarly, the members personally promoted Serra Console to their friends and relatives the day before the actual live, 
         which is February 2, and immediately, the page saw an additional 182 reach, 409 new visits, and 13  new likes. Moreover, on the day 
         f the actual livestream, the page had accumulated a total of 22 likes and 34 followers. Since the moderators also posted promotional 
         material 1 hour before the livestream, the page once again saw an additional 182 in reach, 125 in visits, and 2 in likes.
    </p> 

    <p>
        Based on the limited overview found in Facebook’s Professional Dashboard, the stream accumulated a total of 333 views, 221 post reach, 
        and 463 engagement. In addition, according to a comprehensive report generated by Facebook MetaSuite (See Appendix B, Figure 19 to 24), 
        the livestream peaked at 27 viewers and had 34 reactions, 323 comments, and 9 shares. Similar to the data from the dashboard, the stream 
        had 463 engagements and approximately 1,900 thousand minutes viewed.
    </p> 

    <p>
    Generally speaking, the level of engagement of the page before the actual stream was low, which in turn negatively impacted  the overall
     performance of the stream.  According to the Page Reach and Page Visits report, the increasing trend wasn’t consistent, indicating that
      the number of promotional materials posted weren’t sufficient to build a higher engagement. As a result, only few people were reached 
      and informed of the date and time of the stream. Similarly, since the page only had 42 likes and 60 followers, only a small number of 
      Facebook users were notified when the livestream started airing.
        </p>

    <p>
        Furthermore, the level of engagement of the page affected the performance of the actual livestream in terms of reach. Like stated above, 
        the engagement’s inconsistency led to the poor reach & overall engagement of the stream. The streamers think this could have been avoided
        if the promotional materials were posted daily and more consistently. Consistent posting of promotional materials could have also resulted 
        in a higher number of likes and followers, thus, more people could have been notified once the stream was started. Due to this, the streamers
        are already planning a different approach to effectively build a higher level of engagement in the page, which would hopefully lead to our future
        stream’s better overall performance.
    </p>

 <h2 id="five">V. Viewership</h2> 
 <p>Serra Console recently organized their first live stream on Facebook, which took place on February 3, 2023. This section will analyze the viewership gained by the team during their first live stream and provide insights on how they can improve for future streams. The analysis presented in this paper is based on the data collected from the generated statistics of the live stream on Facebook. Take note that throughout this section, "Appendix B: Facebook Stream and Page Data" will be referred to frequently, it can be navigated using the document outline.</p>  
 <h4>1. Total Views and Shares</h4>
 <p>
    Upon thorough examination of the data, Serra Console has concluded that the first stream of the team gained low viewership.</p> 
<p>
According to Figure 19 (Refer to Appendix B), it shows that Serra Console received, at most, 27 views 
as the amount of peak live viewers throughout the duration of the whole stream. Furthermore, through 
investigating, the graph from Appendix B, "Shares Throughout The Live Stream" (Figure 22), shows that 
the total amount of shares from the live stream was only 9 shares. Taking that into account, Serra Console 
presumes the small amount of shares resulted in low viewership because it did not reach enough people. 
Although the team did share promotional posters and posts on their page before the actual day of the stream, 
inviting their friends and relatives alike to join and support them; The collected data suggests 
that they still lacked in terms of promoting materials and sharing for their stream, which they 
plan to improve upon in the future.</p> 
 </p>  

 <h4>2. Viewer Demographics</h4>
 <p>
    Additionally, if we take a look at the demographics from Figure 25 and Figure 26 (Refer to Appendix B), 
    it is seen that majority of the viewers reside in Metro Manila, with an 18-24 age range that most viewed 
    the stream; Meanwhile the younger teens and older adults were less likely to watch. Serra Console's streaming
     time started from 2:00 PM - 3:15 PM on a Friday, which is usually simultaneous with the time when people are at
      school or work. This suggests that most people would be occupied during that time. The team has taken this into 
      consideration and will discuss if they should adjust the streaming time for future streams. 
 </p>  

 <h4>3. Viewer Retention</h4>
 <p>
    On a positive note if we refer to the 24th figure (Refer to Appendix B), the constant flow of the line indicates 
    that most, if not all viewers, stayed throughout the entire stream. This indicates that the viewers were entertained
    enough to have stayed throughout the whole stream, keeping a mostly constant number of views.
 </p>   

 <p>To summarize, Serra Console's first livestream on Facebook gained low viewership due to the lack of advertising of 
    their stream. The selected streaming time also played a role in this, as it coincided with school and work time on a weekday.
    The team plans to improve their promoting materials and sharing for their future streams and consider adjusting the streaming 
    time to increase viewership. The constant flow of viewers throughout the stream indicates that the viewers found the content
    entertaining, providing a positive outlook for future streams.
